# ibm-bpm-rest-wrapper
A wrapper for the IBM BPM REST API, written in powershell

## What is this?
This repository is about a client library for the IBM Business Process Manager REST API. The tools provided here will enable developers to embed the BPM REST API in automated, scripted setups.

## Who needs this?
These scripts should come in handy for IBM BPM developers who want to automate recurring tasks with scripts on Microsoft Windows.

## Why powershell?
The Process Designer, which is the main development tool for the IBM BPM Standard edition, is only supporting Microsoft Windows right now. On this operation system (from Windows 7 upwards), Powershell is a decent script language that can support you in automating your work efficiently. It comes pre installed and developers will be allowed to use it in most environments.

## Is this official?
No. I am in no way connected to IBM, these scripts were created during my daily work with their product.
